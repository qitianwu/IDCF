## InDuctive Collaborative Filtering (IDCF)

Code and data used in ICML'21 spotlight paper [Towards Open-World Recommendation: An Inductive Model-Based Collaborative Filtering Apparoach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04833). There is a Chinese tutorial [Blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/451858601?) that introduces this work in an easy-to-follow manner.

This work proposes a new collaborative filtering approach for recsys. The new method could achieve inductive learning for new users in testing set and also help to address cold-start problem on user side.

### Dependency

Python 3.8, Pytorch 1.7, Pytorch Geometric 1.6

### Download trained model and data

The trained model and preprocessed data can be downloaded by the Google drive

    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rTfOKZJ-zYrNY9hDUtU9H-UG9fPPQOds?usp=sharing
    
You can make a directory `./data` in the root and download the data into it.

### Reproduce results

To reproduce the results in our paper (i.e. Table 2, 3, 4), you need to first download the trained model and data to corresponding folders and run the `test.py` script in each folder. Take ***Movielens-1M*** dataset as an example. You need to first download the folder `data/ml-1m.pkl` from the Google drive to `./data` in your own computer and download `model/ml-1m/` to `./code/ml-1m/` in your computer. Then you can run

    python ./code/ml-1m/IDCF-NN/test-1m.py

to reproduce the results of ***IDCF-NN*** model on few-shot query users on ***Movielens-1M***. Also, you can run

    python ./code/ml-1m/IDCF-NN/test-1m.py --extra

to reproduce the results of ***IDCF-NN*** model on zero-shot new users on ***Movielens-1M***.

### Run the code for training

Our model needs a two-stage training. To train the model from the beginning, you can run two scripts in order. 

First, you need to run
    
    python ./code/ml-1m/IDCF-NN/pretrain-1m.py

to pretrain the matrix factorization model. Alternatively, you can skip the pretrain stage by directly using our pretrained model, i.e., download the model file from the path `model/ml-1m/IDCF-NN/pretrain-1m/model.pkl` in the Google drive to `./code/ml-1m/IDCF-NN/pretrain-1m/model.pkl` in your computer. 

Second, you need to run the script ***train-1m.py***. 

    python ./code/ml-1m/IDCF-NN/train-1m.py

Also, in our paper, we consider two scenarios: inductive learning for interpolation (for few-shot query users) and inductive learning for extrapolation (for new test users). For running the former case, you need to set the variable EXTRA as False in `train-1m.py`. For the latter case, you can set EXTRA=True in `train-1m.py`.
